# RotN-BPG-Edition-1.0.0- (2.77.5)
 A spin-off title of "Rebirth of the Night," with a more emphasis on RPG elements such as classes, stats, and survival. While solo-play(Apprentice Class) is plausible, it's recommended to play with a group of 2-4 for the most optimal experience. You are encouraged to work together to survive the horrors of the night. Each individual class(Levelup2 & Reskillable) has strengths and weaknesses to contribute to the clan. Combatant classes will focus on fighting and defending allies, with their extra passive skills and new combat perks(Sword Skills & Stealth). Craftsman classes can focus on building tools, armor, potions, and base defenses(Ancient Warfare 2 & Dungeon Tactics). Gatherer classes should focus on farming for food, gathering materials, and overall exploring the world for loot (Treasure 2, Harvestcraft, Aquaculture, & FishingMadeBetter). It up to you and your group to figure out how to work together as a well-oiled machine.
